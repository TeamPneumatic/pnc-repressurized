This item is a [link{menu/pressureTubes}]Tube Module[link{}]. this means that it can be placed on a Pressure Tube only. For general information about Tube Modules click the link.

This module is used to attract or repel entities towards or from the module. When you apply pressurized air the tube will blow entities away and when you make the pipe vacuum it will suck entities towards it. Vacuum is achieved with a [link{block/vacuumPump}]Vacuum Pump[link{}]. When item entities are close enough, they automatically will be put into an adjacent inventory, respecting sided inventories (like Furnaces). The higher the pressure, the bigger the range. This can be expressed with the following formula's:

When pressurized:
[prefix{l}]Range(blocks) = 4 x pressure(bar)[prefix{}]
In vacuum:
[prefix{l}]Range(blocks) = -16 x pressure(bar)[prefix{}]

So for instance, when the module is at 2 bar it will be repelling with a range of (4 x 2 = ) 8 blocks. when it's in a vacuum of -0.5 bar it will have a range of (-16 x -0.5 = ) 8 blocks.

[prefix{l}]Applying an    [link{item/advancedPCB}]Advanced PCB[link{}][prefix{}]
When you apply an Advanced PCB, you'll get control over which Entities will be affected by the module. You could set it up so that only a certain player gets affected, or Creepers only. This all can be done by right clicking the module after you upgraded it with the Advanced PCB. The following GUI will pop up:

It's pretty self-explanatory, you put in the [link{misc/entityFilter}]Entity Filter[link{}] in the text box.
