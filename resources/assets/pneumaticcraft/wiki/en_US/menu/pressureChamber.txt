This is a Pressure Chamber. This multi-block structure is used to compress various materials into others. To build a valid Pressure Chamber you have to make a hollow cube out of Pressure Chamber Walls/Windows. The size of the cube can vary from 3x3x3 to 5x5x5. It doesn't matter whether you use walls or windows. Next you need to make one hole where you place your Pressure Chamber Valve. The Valve has to connect to the air blocks in the Pressure Chamber. You need at least one Valve per Pressure Chamber, but you can add more. When you've successfully built the Pressure Chamber, you'll be able to open the interface of the Pressure Chamber when you right-click any block of it.

[prefix{l}]Compressing Items[prefix{}]
Every time you are going to compress items, you'll have to break the Pressure Chamber for a moment to put items in (unless you're using the [link{block/pressureChamberInterface}]Pressure Chamber Interface[link{}]). This means any pressure stored will be lost. To be compressed items can be thrown in the Pressure Chamber.

When you've done this, you reform the Pressure Chamber. Now if you open the user interface, you'll see something like shown on the upper picture. The pressure gauge has a yellow area, meaning the machine only will compress when it hits the green. In the problems tab you can find the exact pressure you need to compress the materials you've put in. To build up pressure, you can direct air through the Valve(s), like shown on the bottom picture.

Use a [link{block/pressureChamberInterface}]Pressure Chamber Interface[link{}] to automate the Pressure Chamber.

Villager --> Mechanic
A Mechanic is a PneumaticCraft villager which trades PCB Blueprints and Assembly Programs.
