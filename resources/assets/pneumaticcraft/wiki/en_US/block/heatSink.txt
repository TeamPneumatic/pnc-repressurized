The Heat Sink is a block used to get rid of [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/heat}]heat [link{}]. It has a reasonably low resistance to the air, which is used to get rid of the heat. Its general purpose is to help cool down compressors which create heat. Be careful, a Heat Sink hotter than 50 degrees C will burn you when touched!

Heat Sinks are only connecting heat wise on the single solid side of the Heat Sink. So to connect up a row of Heat Sinks, conductors like a [link{block/compressedIronBlock}]Blocks of Compressed Iron[link{}] are required.

You can increase the effectiveness of a Heat Sink by placing it in range of an [link{item/airGrateModule}]Air Grate Module[link{}]. The range is displayed when you place down an Air Grate Tube. The effectiveness can be stacked by using multiple Air Grate Modules.
