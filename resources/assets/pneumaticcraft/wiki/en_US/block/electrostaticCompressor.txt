The Electrostatic Compressor is a tier two air [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/generatingPressure}]compressor [link{}], which uses lightning to create it's air. When it gets struck by lightning it will instantly produce 200000mL of air. Seems like a lot, but how often do you see a Charged Creeper sneaking around? You have to have it get struck. To increase the chance of this happening though you can connect Iron Bars to this machine that act as a conductor for the lightning bolt. Advice would be to create a grid of Iron Bars. When you connect up more Electrostatic Compressors the energy is being shared between them. To prevent a Electrostatic Compressor from blowing up when the pressure gets too high after a lightning impact, you can connect up Iron Bars on the bottom side of the machine. This way the energy can be redirected to the ground instead of going in the machine. This redirecting only happens when the dangerous pressure of the Electrostatic Compressor has been reached, not sooner.
