A Refinery is a machine which uses [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/heat}]heat [link{}] to refine Oil into various fuels. It starts to work at 100 degrees Celsius. The higher temperature applied, the faster it refines. All fuels that can be produced are, sorted from lightest to heaviest:

• LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas)
• Gasoline (equivalent to BuildCraft's Fuel or Thermal Expansion's Refined Fuel)
• Kerosene
• Diesel

Refineries cannot operate with a single block: multiple Refineries need to be stacked on top of each other to operate, ranging from 2 to 4 Refineries. Different amounts give different yields:

2 Refineries:
• LPG         (2mB)
• Diesel      (4mB)

3 Refineries:
• LPG         (2mB)
• Kerosene  (3mB)
• Diesel      (2mB)

4 Refineries:
• LPG         (2mB)
• Gasoline   (3mB)
• Kerosene  (3mB)
• Diesel      (2mB)

The lightest fuel will always end up in the top Refinery, the heaviest in the bottom.  If you add more Refinery blocks to an existing stack, the Refinery will do its best to automatically rearrange any existing output liquids into their correct block, to keep the Refinery system running.

All produced liquids can be used as fuel in a [link{block/liquid_compressor}]Liquid Compressor[link{}]. However, there are two other very important uses: LPG is used to make liquid Plastic, and Diesel is used to make Lubricant for Speed Upgrades.  A [link{block/thermopneumatic_processing_plant}]Thermopneumatic Processing Plant[link{}] is used for both of these processes.

[prefix{l}]Comparator (has work?)[prefix{}]
The Refinery will work with a Comparator: it will output a signal strength of 15 when the Refinery has work, and 0 otherwise. It has work when there's Oil to refine, and space in the output tanks for the refined products.









[prefix{l}]Refinery Setup Tips[prefix{}]
Since the Refinery is a multiblock with many faces exposed to the air, it can lose heat quite rapidly if not well insulated. Therefore, it's strongly recommended to cover all unused faces of the Refinery to maximize efficiency. Note that any non-heat-conducting blocks can be used, including semi-solid blocks like slabs or trapdoors.

You can use a [link{block/vortex_tube}]Vortex Tube[link{}] to heat the Refinery, or place hot fluids (Lava...) or blocks (Magma...) next to any Refinery blocks.  Note that such fluids and blocks will be used up (their heat gets drained), so you might wish to find a way to automate the production and placement of those resources.
