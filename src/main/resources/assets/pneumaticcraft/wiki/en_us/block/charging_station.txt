The Charging Station is a machine in which pneumatic items can be charged (or discharged). The interaction between the Charging Station and pneumatic items is the same as for the interaction between tubes/machines: differences in pressures will be equalized. This means that you'll need a highly pressurized Charging Station to charge items to a high pressure.

Most charged items have a maximum pressure of 10 bar. Don't worry about explosions though; items will not explode due to overcharging, but simply stop charging beyond 10 bar.

[prefix{l}]Charge Pad[prefix{}]
You can turn the Charging Station into a Charge Pad by putting in a [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/machine_upgrades}]Dispenser Upgrade[link{}]. This will charge any items lying on top of the Station and/or items that are in a player's inventory who is standing on top of the Station. The pad can be camouflaged with a [link{item/camo_applicator}]Camouflage Applicator[link{}].

[prefix{l}]Upgrade Management[prefix{}]
The Charging Station also doubles as an upgrade management system for items which accept upgrades (currently, only Drones and Pneumatic Armor). To upgrade an item, place it in the Charging Station as a normal, and click the 'Inv' button just above the item slot. This opens a separate GUI in which upgrades can be inserted; every applicable upgrade for the inserted item is documented in a GUI side tab.

This is a list of the current items that can be charged:
