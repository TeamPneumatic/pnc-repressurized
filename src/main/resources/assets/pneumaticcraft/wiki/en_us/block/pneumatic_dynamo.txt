The Pneumatic Dynamo converts compressed air into Forge Energy (effectively Redstone Flux). It produces 40 RF/tick by default, but can be upgraded with [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/machine_upgrades}]Speed Upgrades[link{}]. The RF output rate of the Flux Compressor is twice the amount of the current production. This means it's 80 RF/tick by default, but can be increased via Speed Upgrades.

An important factor that influences efficiency is the dynamo's temperature. The dynamo needs to be [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/heat}] cooled[link{}], or its efficiency will drop as the temperature rises, up to the point where no air is generated at all.
