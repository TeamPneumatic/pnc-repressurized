This special [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/pressureChamber}]Pressure Chamber[link{}] block can be used to automate the compression of items. This can be done with Hoppers or with a techmod of your choice (like Buildcraft). To do this place a Pressure Chamber Interface like you would place a Pressure Chamber Valve: It has to be orientated right and has to touch an air block of the Pressure Chamber. The Interface has two modes: Export Mode, which means it will export items out of the Pressure Chamber, and Import Mode, which means it will import items into the Pressure Chamber. You can determine in which mode it will operate by how you place the Interface. If you place it with the 'I' (Import) on the outside of the Pressure Chamber, it’s in import mode. Likewise having the 'O' (Output) on the outside will put the Interface in Export mode.

[prefix{l}]Interface Filters[prefix{}]
There are several ways to select which items should be imported/exported in/out an Interface. You can switch between them by clicking on the button in the Filter tab. The following is a list of all the different filters:

[image{320, 310,0.5, pneumaticcraft:textures/wiki/interfaceItemFilter.png}]
[prefix{n}]Item [prefix{}], sorts on item. Only items which are the same as the items in this filter are allowed to pass through.  Leaving the filter empty will allow the Interface to import/export any item.

-[prefix{n}]Item Name* contains 'x'[prefix{}], when an item name contains a certain word the item is allowed to go through. If you want to, for example, extract all ingots, you can do this by filling in 'ingot' in the textbox. Every item with the word 'ingot' in it will be exported/imported.

-[prefix{n}]Item Name* begins with 'x'[prefix{}], when an item name begins with a certain word the item is allowed to go through. With this, you could sort items alphabetically. If you want to extract items beginning with an 'a' only, fill in 'a' in the textbox.

[image{320, 580,0.5, pneumaticcraft:textures/wiki/filterCreative.png}]
-[prefix{n}]Creative Tab[prefix{}], The item only will be allowed to go through when it can be found in the Creative Tab set in the Interface. If you want to extract all tools (but nothing more) you can set the creative tab to ‘Tools’, as all Vanilla tools can be found in that creative tab. Note that this filter is only available in SSP!

[prefix{n}]*)Note: [prefix{}]Item names are language setting dependant. When playing on a server the server's language is decisive.

[prefix{l}]Auto Ejecting[prefix{}]
When the Interface is in output mode, it will auto-eject into an adjacent inventory. It will also auto-eject into Buildcraft pipes.

[prefix{l}]Air Usage[prefix{}]
Even though utilizing the Pressure Chamber Interface saves energy, as the user doesn't have to break the whole Pressure Chamber, it is not free to use the interface in any way. It costs 1000mL per item transfered. This means, that for a full stack, the Pressure Chamber Interface will need 4 bar out of the Pressure Chamber to be able to transfer it. So don't be surprised if the Interface 'gets stuck', it's just waiting for more pressure to build up. Top tip: when compressing iron, convert the Iron Ingots into blocks first before interfacing them into the chamber. This saves 8/9 of the air.
