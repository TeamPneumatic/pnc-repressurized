With a Remote you can create your own GUI (Graphical User Interface). This user interface can be used to remotely control [link{item/drone}]Drones [link{}] or [link{block/universalSensor}]Universal Sensors[link{}] via [link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/coordinateOperator}]variable [link{}] manipulation. Note that with Universal Sensors, you can use these Remotes to create wireless redstone!

To start creating your own GUI, sneak right click the Remote. This will open up the editor window. Filling in the window works similar to how programming in a [link{programmer}]Programmer [link{}] works. Simply click and drag widgets from the right panel into the main panel on the left. To copy a widget, middle click and drag an existing widget. To edit the properties of a widget, right click the widget. For a button, this will open up the following window:

[image{200,465,0.35,pneumaticcraft:textures/wiki/remoteButton.png}]

In this window you can configure how the button should look like and how it should behave.

[prefix{l}]Text: [prefix{}]
The text displayed in the Button.
For the Label widget this can include a special tag: You can include the value of [link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/coordinateOperator}]variables [link{}] by including ${<varName>} in the name. For example:

"Counter: ${counter}"

When the counter is equal to x=1, y=2, z=3, the Label will be shown as "Counter: 1, 2, 3". This is nice for debugging purposes.

By postfixing the variable name with ".x", ".y" or ".z" you can just show one value. For instance:

"Counter: ${counter.x}"

Given a value of x=1, y=2, z=3, the Label will be shown as "Counter: 1".

[prefix{l}]Tooltip: [prefix{}]
When it has text, this will show as tooltip text when the mouse hovers over this button.

[prefix{l}]Variable name:[prefix{}]
The name of the (global) variable this button will set, when the button gets pressed.

[prefix{l}]Setting Value:[prefix{}]
The value the variable gets set to when the button gets pressed.

[prefix{l}]Width: [prefix{}]
The width of the button widget. Can be increased to make the text fit, or to make the button line up nicely with other widgets.

[prefix{l}]Height: [prefix{}]
The height of the button widget. Can only be decreased to allow for mini buttons (as buttons will look _really_ weird when sized up).

[prefix{l}]Enabling variable:[prefix{}]
When filled in, the button will only be visible and sensitive to mouse clicks, when the variable specified is evaluated true. This means that the variable has an X value that is not equal to 0.



[prefix{l}]Copying Remote lay-outs (other Remotes or Pastebin)[prefix{}]
You can copy a lay-out from an existing remote by clicking one of the buttons on the left side of the editor.

[prefix{l}]Protecting a Remote[prefix{}]
If you're borrowing your Remote you might not want to allow this user to modify your lay-out. By right clicking your Remote on a Security Station, editing the Remote lay-out is limited to the ones that have access to the Security Station.
