Etching Acid is used to chemically develop [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/printedCircuitBoards}]PCB's [link{}]. Etching Acid is made in a Pressure Chamber:

When you have a PCB That is exposed by light of a [link{block/uvLightBox}]UV Lightbox[link{}] you can throw the Empty (exposed) PCB in Etching Acid. The PCB needs to be etched for 5 minutes. You can pick it up while it's being etched to see the progress. You'll have to pick it up as a matter of fact, to prevent despawning. Seems like a nuisance, but now you have another thing to automate! After these 5 minutes, the Empty (exposed) PCB turns into an Unassembled PCB when succeeded, or in a Failed PCB when not. A Failed PCB can be thrown in a Furnace to be turned into an Empty PCB (not exposed).
