# PneumaticCraft: Repressurized - Changelog

This is an overview of significant new features and fixes by release.  See https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/commits/master for a detailed list of all changes.

Changes are in reverse chronological order; newest changes at the top.

## Minecraft 1.12.2

## 0.3.1-125 (18 Jan 2018)

* Fix AbstractMethodError crashes introduced in 0.3.0.

## 0.3.0-124 (17 Jan 2018)

* Added Transfer Widget, an early game item/fluid transfer item that can be placed _between_ blocks.
* Added Spawner Agitator, which keeps Mob Spawners active even if players are not around.
* Added Crop Support, an item which when placed on a crop improves growth speed.
* Network Data Storage item now shows required puzzle pieces in its item tooltip when holding Shift
* Big performance improvement when searching in the item search GUI
* Better default orientation of the Omnidirection Hopper when it's placed: output now faces the clicked block, and input faces the player.
* The size limit for programming puzzle piece areas has been increased from 100,000 to 250,000 and can now be adjusted in config (see I:maxProgrammingArea)
* The size limit for programming puzzle piece areas is now validated in the Programmer before the drone is programmed, instead of forcing a drone with an over-large area to suicide after it's placed.
* Fixed (hopefully) reflection-based crashes on startup when running with certain ASM-using coremods
* Fixed NPE's when breaking certain inventories or tanks with a Logistics Frame attached
* Fixed item dupe when Logistics Drone imported from inventories under certain circumstances
* Breaking any PneumaticCraft: Repressurized inventory in creative mode now drops the inventory contents instead of voiding them
* Fixed clientside crash when selecting the "Check For Air" option in "Condition: Block" programming widget
* Performance improvement: the tile entities for Pressure Chamber Wall/Glass & Elevator Frames no longer tick. Pressure Chamber Glass should be fine to use in small-scale decorative builds, or for its excellent blast-resistant properties. 
* Lots of work (mainly cleanup) on the In-Game-Wiki docs.
* Fixed Elevator Callers not working above the level of Elevator Frames - frames can now stop two blocks below the top Elevator Caller (thanks TeamSpen210)

## 0.2.2-102 (25 Dec 2017)

* Fixed crash when removing an opened Pneumatic Door in survival mode.

## 0.2.1-101 (25 Dec 2017)

* Added CraftTweaker support for liquid fuels used in the Liquid Compressors and Kerosene Lamp.
* Vortex tube tube now briefly shows its hot and cold sides when placed or rotated
* Fixed the Heat Sink looking like it is facing up when actually facing down.
* Fixed CraftTweaker 'RemoveAllRecipes' function not working for all recipe handlers.
* Fixed item dupe when breaking charging stations holding items (helmet/drone...) with installed upgrades 
* Fixed fully UV Lightbox-ed Empty PCB's stacking with new Empty PCB's
* Fixed explosion-handling event related server crash after killing the wither (and potentially in other situations)
* Fixed keypresses in Programmer GUI "leaking" when the naming textfield was focused (e.g. pressing 'z' would do an Undo action)
* Zoom scrollbar in Programmer GUI can now be dragged with mouse (you can also zoom in/out with mouse wheel)
* Zoom behaviour in Programmer GUI is now more consistent (zoom in & back out and you will be at the same place in the view)
* Fixed NPE when stacking Elevator Base blocks vertically
* A sound effect now plays when writing a program to a Drone.
* Added missing translations for Pneumatic Helmet keybindings.
* Changed default keybinding for opening the Pneumatic Helmet from 'F' to 'U' (as 'F' is the 'switch to offhand' button).
* Fixed Drones causing a crash in very specific situations in combination with FTB Utiltities (having to do with authorization).
* Bugfix: Forestry ethanol does not get registered as a fuel and posts a stacktrace in the log.

## 0.2.0-85 (12 Dec 2017)

* Fixed Pneumatic Helmet block tracker client crash with unopened loot chests
* Fixed Pneumatic Helmet entity tracker client crash when targeting other players

* IC2 machines are back: Pneumatic Generator and Electric Compressor (but lacking the pretty models they had in 1.7.10, sorry)
* Air Compressor & Advanced Air Compressor no longer take fuel buckets
* Furnace burn time of fuel buckets is now configurable, and 10x shorter by default than before
* Drone pathfinding is a lot better now
* Drone "Right Click Block" now works a lot better
* Drones now render their held item (can be disabled in config)
* Empty PCB's now stack
* Build artifacts (including API) are now available at https://modmaven.k-4u.nl/me/desht/pneumaticcraft/pneumaticcraft-repressurized/
* Recipes are now pretty much all done with JSON
